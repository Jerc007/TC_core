## 🧩 Overview

This repository collects several fundamental blocks used in the Datapath of Tensor Core units (an in-chip hardware accelerator commonly found in GPUs and processors) [ [1] ](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/ispass/2019/08695642/19wBevIF5T2) [ [2] ](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10338919B2/en) [ [3] ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9007413)

The synthesizable VHDL IP cores are designed for ease of integration as a coprocessor or accelerator on Processor-based systems.

Ideal for [your use case: e.g., embedded systems, SoC design, digital signal processing], it offers:

[- ✅ Standards-compliant design ([e.g., AXI4-Lite, AMBA, Wishbone])]: # 
- 🔧 Configurable parameters
- 🧪 Fully testbenched with simulation support
- 📚 Clean documentation with example integrations
