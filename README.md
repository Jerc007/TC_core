#  TC_core

*Low-level micro-architecture description of the datapath for Tensor Cores (Tensor Core Units, or Matrix Cores)*

---

## 🧩 Overview

This repository collects the fundamental blocks used in the Datapath of Tensor Core units (an in-chip hardware accelerator commonly found in GPUs and processors) [ [1] ](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/ispass/2019/08695642/19wBevIF5T2) [ [2] ](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10338919B2/en)

This synthesizable VHDL IP core is designed for ease of integration. 

Ideal for [your use case: e.g., embedded systems, SoC design, digital signal processing], it offers:

- ✅ Standards-compliant design ([e.g., AXI4-Lite, AMBA, Wishbone])
- 🔧 Configurable parameters
- 🧪 Fully testbenched with simulation support
- 📚 Clean documentation with example integrations
